The answer offers "For example the following cycle occurs around the T
prototype:

101 111 101 111
000 000 000 000
010 010 000 000"

My software gives the cycle as instead:

101 111 111
000 000 000
010 010 010

a. That TAN12 is to be a 0 in the third stms on inputs 1110 is contrary to the
p14 truth table.

b. That TAN32 is to be a 0 in the third stms on inputs 0001 is also contrary
to the p14 truth table.
